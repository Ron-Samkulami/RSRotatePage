# RSRotatePage
This is a project showing how to change the orientation of a viewController, eventhough that orientation was not indecated in the Info.plist or supported in AppDelegate. 
This might be helpful if you are developing SDK and cannot change the master App's supported orientations setting.
All right, talk is cheap, see the code.
